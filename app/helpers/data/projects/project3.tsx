              This project presents a detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics
              (CFD) analysis of compressible airflow through a two-dimensional
              converging-diverging (CD) nozzle using Ansys Fluent. The primary
              aim was to investigate how subsonic flow accelerates to supersonic
              speeds, observe changes in static pressure and Mach number along
              the nozzle, and evaluate the flow regime under choked and expanded
              conditions.

              CD nozzles are crucial components in propulsion systems,
              especially in aerospace and defense industries, where the
              conversion of thermal energy into directed kinetic energy is
              essential for producing thrust. This CFD simulation helped in
              visualizing how flow behaves under high pressure ratios, enabling
              better understanding and design of nozzle-based exhaust and
              propulsion systems.

              The approach involved creating a high-quality 2D structured mesh
              of the nozzle geometry with mesh refinement near the throat and
              outlet regions to accurately capture pressure gradients and shock
              formations. The simulation was set up using Ansys Fluent, with

            The Mach number contour clearly shows the acceleration of flow from
            subsonic (blue) in the converging section to Mach 1 at the throat,
            and further increase to Mach 1.55 (red) in the divergent section.
            The continuous color transition confirms a smooth acceleration and
            validates the presence of supersonic flow, typical in well-designed
            CD nozzles under the given boundary conditions. The results match
            closely with isentropic flow theory, indicating the absence of shock

            The static pressure contour reveals a strong pressure drop along the
            nozzle. The pressure is highest at the inlet (red) and reduces
            progressively towards the outlet (cyan), which corresponds to the
            expansion of the flow as it accelerates. The color gradient suggests
            efficient energy conversion from pressure to kinetic energy. No
            adverse pressure gradients or backflow were observed, confirming the
            nozzle operates in a well-expanded regime under these conditions.

            This CFD study successfully demonstrated the application of Ansys
            Fluent for simulating compressible flow through a
            converging-diverging nozzle. The simulation results provided
            valuable insights into how pressure and velocity vary throughout the

            generation.

            essential tool for analyzing high-speed internal flows in propulsion
            systems. Engineers can rely on such simulations to validate nozzle

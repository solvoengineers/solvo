              This project involved a comprehensive Finite Element Analysis
              (FEA) of a custom-designed industrial fixture assembly to evaluate
              its structural performance under static loading conditions. The
              primary goal was to assess the fixture's mechanical strength,
              displacement, strain behavior, and safety factor, and to identify
              opportunities for geometry-based optimization to ensure high
              stiffness, minimal deformation, and structural integrity under
              operational loads.

              The simulation was performed using SolidWorks Simulation,
              employing bonded contact conditions and global meshing across a
              multi-part assembly. The results provided critical insights into
              stress concentrations, displacement profiles, and design
              margins—crucial for ensuring reliability and durability in a
              production environment.

                The simulation revealed a maximum stress of 146.8 MPa at Node
                13,616 and a minimum stress of 2.25 kPa. The highest stress
                concentrations were observed around localized connection points
                and mounting interfaces. However, all stress values remained
                well within the yield strength of the structural steel used
                (typically above 250 MPa), confirming the component's structural

            The FEA results confirmed that the industrial fixture design is
            structurally sound, exhibiting low deformation, acceptable stress
            levels, and a high safety margin. The minimal displacement observed
            under an applied force of nearly 7.7 kN demonstrates that the
            fixture is well-suited for both heavy-duty and precision
            manufacturing applications. Given the very high safety factor, there
            is significant potential for geometry optimization to further
            enhance performance and efficiency. Possible improvements include
            reducing material volume in low-stress regions to decrease overall
            weight, modifying fillet radii or hole placements to eliminate
            localized stress concentrations, and streamlining the fixture
            geometry to improve manufacturability and cost efficiency without
            compromising structural integrity. Overall, this analysis highlights
            an effective design-to-validation workflow in which CAE tools such
            as FEA are utilized early in the development phase to ensure optimal
            performance, structural reliability, and reduced prototyping costs.

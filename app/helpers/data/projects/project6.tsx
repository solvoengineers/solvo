              This project focused on performing a detailed Computational Fluid
              Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a custom duct geometry to evaluate and
              optimize its cooling performance. The analysis was conducted using
              Ansys Fluent 2024 R2, simulating airflow behavior through a curved
              duct with internal components designed to enhance heat transfer
              and airflow distribution.

              The main objective was to identify high-velocity zones, pressure
              drop regions, and flow separation areas to propose design
              improvements that would lead to more uniform cooling, reduced
              recirculation, and better aerodynamic efficiency. This type of CFD
              study is crucial in applications such as HVAC systems, electronics
              cooling, battery thermal management, and industrial ventilation
              systems where optimized duct flow directly impacts system
              performance and reliability.

              The study used a steady-state, incompressible flow model with a
              turbulence solver (SST k-omega) to resolve near-wall effects. The
              model included features such as turning vanes, flow splitters, and
              an impeller-like component that significantly affected flow
              direction and speed. The domain was meshed using a fine resolution
              grid to capture detailed flow features, especially in curved and
              confined regions.

            As shown in the velocity plot, the airflow undergoes significant
            curvature through the duct, with velocities increasing near the
            impeller region. The flow accelerates around the bend and aligns
            vertically in the outlet section. Streamlines indicate effective
            flow guidance after the fan blades, with minimal swirl at the
            outlet, suggesting well-balanced flow redirection. Maximum flow
            velocity reached approximately 433 m/s, with localized acceleration
            observed at narrow cross-sections and vane exits.

            The pressure distribution plot reveals a high-pressure zone at the
            duct's inlet and near the rotor base, gradually decreasing along the
            duct's length. The pressure drop is evident across the impeller
            region, where the conversion of pressure energy to kinetic energy
            drives flow acceleration. The highest static pressure recorded was
            around 1.2 × 10⁵ Pa, with notable pressure gradients occurring at
            the transition between the horizontal and vertical duct segments.

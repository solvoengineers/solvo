              This project focused on performing a comprehensive HVAC (Heating,
              Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) simulation of a warehouse using
              Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in Ansys. The primary objective
              was to improve natural ventilation efficiency and optimize airflow
              patterns within the warehouse to enhance occupant comfort, ensure
              air quality, and reduce dependence on forced mechanical
              ventilation systems.

              Warehouses are typically large enclosed spaces with limited
              airflow control, making natural ventilation critical for
              maintaining a safe and comfortable environment. By evaluating air
              velocity, pressure distribution, and turbulence behavior
              throughout the duct system, the study aimed to identify regions of
              stagnation or poor flow and implement design modifications for
              enhanced airflow performance.

                The airflow analysis revealed a maximum velocity of 6.8 m/s,
                observed near the diffuser outlets, while the minimum velocity
                occurred near the duct junctions and far-field regions within
                the warehouse. The velocity cut plots demonstrated strong
                airflow patterns near the ceiling-level diffusers, ensuring
                effective air delivery to the upper zones. However, stagnation
                zones were identified near the lower rear end of the warehouse,
                indicating areas where airflow distribution could be improved
                for more uniform ventilation.

              The pressure contour plots indicated a moderate pressure drop from
              the inlet to the diffuser outlets. This result confirms that the
              duct system design effectively pulls air through the network with
              minimal resistance and efficient flow continuity. The overall
              pressure behavior suggests that the airflow is being managed well
              across the system, with no significant losses that could
              compromise ventilation efficiency.

            Localized turbulence zones were detected within small connector
            ducts positioned between the main duct and the diffusers. These
            regions, highlighted by red and yellow contours in the simulation,
            represented areas of increased chaotic flow. The turbulence was
            primarily caused by reduced cross-sectional areas and sharp bends
            within these connector ducts, which disrupted the otherwise smooth
            airflow pattern.

            To enhance the overall airflow efficiency, several improvements are
            recommended. The small rigid connector ducts should be replaced with
            flexible ducting featuring larger hydraulic diameters to minimize
            turbulence intensity. Additionally, optimizing the diffuser
            orientation and outlet shape can improve the evenness of airflow
            distribution throughout the warehouse. Lastly, increasing the number
            of air inlets at strategic points will promote better
            cross-ventilation, particularly in areas prone to stagnation,
            ensuring a more balanced and efficient air circulation system.

            The CFD simulation clearly demonstrated that natural ventilation in
            warehouse environments can be significantly enhanced by modifying
            the duct geometry, diffuser placement, and airflow paths. Through
            this simulation, we provided a clear roadmap for reducing
            turbulence, maximizing natural flow, and enhancing indoor air
            distribution without relying entirely on powered HVAC components.

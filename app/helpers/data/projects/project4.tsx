              This project involved a comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamics
              (CFD) analysis to evaluate and optimize the aerodynamic
              performance of a multi-rotor drone platform. The primary objective
              was to reduce drag, improve lift distribution, and enhance overall
              flight stability under various operating conditions. By simulating
              airflow over the drone structure using Ansys Fluent, the project
              aimed to identify high-drag regions, streamline body contours, and
              improve aerodynamic efficiency for longer flight times and better
              maneuverability.

              With the growing demand for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) across
              industries including surveillance, delivery, and environmental
              monitoring, optimizing the aerodynamic behavior of drones is
              critical. Even small improvements in aerodynamic performance can
              lead to significant gains in flight range, energy consumption, and
              thermal load distribution on onboard systems.

              A high-resolution 3D model of the drone was prepared, including
              propeller geometry, motor mounts, and key aerodynamic surfaces.
              The simulations were performed using Ansys Fluent with turbulence
              modeling (k-omega SST) and pressure-based solver for
              incompressible steady flow. Parametric studies were conducted with
              varying flight speeds and angles of attack to replicate hover,
              climb, and cruise modes.

                High drag concentration was observed at the arm-body junctions
                and under the central fuselage due to flow stagnation.

                Propeller-induced downwash significantly influenced flow
                behavior near the rear arms, indicating the need for asymmetric

                Streamlining the landing gear and smoothing the underbody

                The wake profile showed enhanced symmetry after modifying the

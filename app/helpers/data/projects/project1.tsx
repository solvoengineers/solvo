              This project focused on performing a detailed coupled thermal and
              mechanical stress analysis of a standard 1U CubeSat intended for
              low Earth orbit operations. The objective was to study how
              combined temperature variations and mechanical loads would
              influence the overall structural integrity of the satellite during
              its mission lifecycle. These conditions included the high
              mechanical stresses generated during the launch phase and the
              large temperature fluctuations experienced in space as the CubeSat
              transitions between sunlight and shadowed regions of orbit.

              The analysis was designed to represent realistic mission
              conditions. This involved applying both transient thermal cycles
              and mechanical load cases simultaneously to evaluate the
              satellite's ability to withstand operational extremes. Advanced
              finite element analysis (FEA) techniques were utilized to
              establish an accurate multiphysics simulation environment capable
              of capturing temperature-dependent material behavior and stress
              response. The coupled simulation helped predict how thermal
              expansion, contraction, and structural deflection interact when
              exposed to space conditions.

            A high-fidelity finite element model of the CubeSat's structure was
            developed for the analysis. The model included all key subsystems
            such as outer panels, internal frames, fasteners, and PCB mounting
            surfaces. Special attention was given to mesh refinement in areas
            near screw holes, joints, and electronic housing interfaces where
            local stress peaks were anticipated. The thermal environment was
            modeled using a transient heat transfer analysis, followed by a
            fully coupled thermal-structural simulation to assess the mechanical

            The coupled thermal-mechanical analysis provided key insights into
            the CubeSat's performance under realistic conditions. The results
            showed that the structural configuration remained within acceptable
            stress limits under all simulated scenarios, but several notable
            findings emerged.

            Localized thermal gradients caused small but measurable deformations
            around the mounting brackets and hinge connections, suggesting the
            potential for minor misalignments in the deployment mechanism. The
            highest stress concentrations appeared near internal joint
            intersections and cutout edges of the panels. Under combined thermal
            and mechanical loading, the peak Von Mises stress increased by
            approximately 15–18 percent compared to mechanical-only simulations.
            This demonstrated the critical influence of thermal effects on the
            overall stress field.

            Based on the results, minor geometric improvements were recommended,
            including the addition of fillets at sharp intersections and
            optimization of panel thickness to enhance stiffness while
            maintaining mass constraints. The modified design achieved better
            thermal stress distribution, improved load transfer efficiency, and
            reduced the risk of fatigue or deformation during launch and orbital
            operation.

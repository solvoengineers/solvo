              This project focused on conducting a computational fluid dynamics
              (CFD) study to examine the aerodynamic behavior around an Ahmed
              body model with different rear slant angles. The Ahmed body,
              widely used as a benchmark in vehicle aerodynamics research,
              provides valuable insight into flow separation, drag
              characteristics, and wake formation patterns. This study aimed to
              analyze how variations in the slant angle influence flow behavior,
              pressure distribution, and aerodynamic drag, using Ansys Fluent as
              the primary simulation tool.

            <p className="text-base  text-footer-text font-normal font-poppins">
              The analysis involved simulating external incompressible flow over
              the Ahmed body for several slant angles ranging from low to high
              values. Each configuration was studied under identical inlet
              conditions to isolate the influence of slant geometry. The
              numerical simulations included turbulence modeling to accurately
              predict recirculation zones and wake behavior behind the body. Key
              performance indicators such as drag coefficient, vortex formation,
              and surface pressure were extracted for comparison and evaluation.

            <p className="text-base  text-footer-text font-normal font-poppins">
              This type of analysis is critical in automotive aerodynamic
              design, as optimizing the rear-end geometry of a vehicle can
              significantly reduce pressure drag and improve fuel efficiency.
              The project's findings provided a comprehensive understanding of
              how rear geometry modifications can impact the overall aerodynamic
              performance of bluff bodies, particularly under turbulent flow
              regimes.

            behavior evolves with changing slant angles. Key findings include:

          <ul className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <li className="text-base  text-footer-text font-normal font-poppins">
              At lower slant angles (25° and 30°), the flow remained mostly
              attached to the slanted rear surface, resulting in relatively
              lower drag and more stable wake.
            </li>
            <li className="text-base  text-footer-text font-normal font-poppins">
              At a slant angle of 35°, partial separation occurred, increasing
              the wake width and causing a noticeable rise in pressure drag.
            </li>
            <li className="text-base  text-footer-text font-normal font-poppins">
              At 40°, complete flow separation took place along the slant
              surface, forming a large recirculation bubble in the wake and
              significantly increasing the drag coefficient.
            </li>
            <li className="text-base  text-footer-text font-normal font-poppins">
              The drag coefficient was observed to increase non-linearly with
              slant angle, highlighting a critical angle where flow separation
              begins to dominate the aerodynamic response.
